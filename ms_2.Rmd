# Sanjana Ramrajvel: Homelessness in the U.S

The author of this website analyzed how effective homeless shelters were in matching the homeless population with availabile beds across the US. Some cons of the data analysis include unclear labeling of the axes. For example, for one chart called "Trends in the number of beds available for people experiencing homelessness from 2007-2018," the y-axis is labeled as "Total Year Round Beds (ES, TH, SH)", but ES, TH, and SH are not defined anywhere. In the "Overall" portion of the website, there is a graph of the total homeless population and beds available in the US, as well as individual states, but I would have liked to see a graph with all the states and their proportional homeless population and beds available so that I can easily compare them. Some pros of the data visualization was definitely the "Annual Percentage of Unsheltered Homeless Individuals" graph, which was coloured by state. The graph was very visually pleasing. However, again, the labelling of the x-axis was unclear and jumbled, so it was hard to read.
